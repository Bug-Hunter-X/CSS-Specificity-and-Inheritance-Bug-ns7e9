The following CSS code snippet suffers from a subtle issue related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
div {
  font-size: 16px;
}

.container div {
  font-size: 18px;
}

.container p {
  font-size: 14px;
}

.container p.special {
  font-size: 20px;
}
```

The problem lies in the unexpected behavior when a `<p>` element with the class `special` is nested within a `.container` div.  The `font-size` is not 20px as expected, but rather 14px.  This is because the selector `.container p` is more specific than `div`, which applies to the parent div.
